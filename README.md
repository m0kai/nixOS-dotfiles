# nixOS-dotfiles
Configuration files for my personal NixOS build. Most of these are default with slight customizations, with more customizations coming as I work on my build over time. This will likely be the most updated repo as I liked Arch more than Manjaro, and I am divorcing Arch for NixOS. I doubt anyone is reading this, except maybe a hacker trying to OSINT my build, in which case, good luck :)

### dotfiles for following software
- NixOS
- hyprland
- hyprpaper
- hyprlock
- waybar
- kitty

More to be added later as I continue to fiddle with the OS at my leasure.
